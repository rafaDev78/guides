### Step 1: Confirm the Evidence (The Debug Log is Key)

First, we must be absolutely certain about *which* user is running the code. How are you determining it's the Automated Process user? The Salesforce debug log is our source of truth.

1.  **Find the Correct Log:** The Platform Event trigger runs in its own, separate transaction. Do not look at the log from the initial REST API call.
    *   In Setup -> Debug Logs, you will see a separate log entry.
    *   The "Operation" column will show something like `/event/PromptRequest__e` (the API name of your event).
    *   The **"User" column** for that specific log entry is the most important piece of evidence. Does it show your user's name, or does it show "Automated Process"?

2.  **Add In-Code Verification:** Let's add explicit debug statements to leave no room for doubt. This is the ultimate proof.

Modify your handler class and your Queueable class:

**`PromptRequestEventHandler.cls`**

```apex
public with sharing class PromptRequestEventHandler {
    public static void handleEvents(List<PromptRequest__e> events) {
        // *** ADD THIS DEBUG LINE ***
        System.debug(LoggingLevel.ERROR, '--- EventHandler Entry Point ---');
        System.debug(LoggingLevel.ERROR, 'Code is running as User: ' + UserInfo.getUserName());
        System.debug(LoggingLevel.ERROR, 'User ID: ' + UserInfo.getUserId());
        System.debug(LoggingLevel.ERROR, 'Profile ID: ' + UserInfo.getProfileId());
        System.debug(LoggingLevel.ERROR, '------------------------------');
        
        Set<Id> allRecordIds = new Set<Id>();
        // ... (rest of your code) ...

        if (!allRecordIds.isEmpty()) {
            System.enqueueJob(new PromptTemplateServiceQueueable(allRecordIds));
        }
    }
}
```

**`PromptTemplateServiceQueueable.cls`**

```apex
public with sharing class PromptTemplateServiceQueueable implements Queueable, Database.AllowsCallouts {
    // ... (constructor) ...

    public void execute(QueueableContext context) {
        // *** ADD THIS DEBUG LINE ***
        System.debug(LoggingLevel.ERROR, '--- Queueable Entry Point ---');
        System.debug(LoggingLevel.ERROR, 'Queueable is running as User: ' + UserInfo.getUserName());
        System.debug(LoggingLevel.ERROR, 'User ID: ' + UserInfo.getUserId());
        System.debug(LoggingLevel.ERROR, '---------------------------');

        // ... (rest of your code for the Connect API call) ...
    }
}
```

Now, run your process again and check the debug log for the `/event/PromptRequest__e` transaction. The `ERROR` level debugs will be bright red and easy to find. This will tell us definitively who is executing the code at both stages.

### Step 2: Verify the Configuration in the System

It's possible the Tooling API call to create the `PlatformEventSubscriberConfig` record appeared to succeed but didn't link correctly. Let's query the system to prove the configuration exists and is correct.

Run this query in the **Tooling API** context (Developer Console -> "Use Tooling API" checkbox):

```sql
SELECT Id, DeveloperName, ApexTriggerId, ApexTrigger.Name, UserId, User.Name
FROM PlatformEventSubscriberConfig
WHERE ApexTrigger.Name = 'PromptRequestEventTrigger'
```

This query should return exactly one record. Verify:
*   `ApexTrigger.Name` is your trigger.
*   `User.Name` is the user you intended (e.g., "AI Prompt Integration User" or your own user).

If this query returns no records, or if the `UserId` is wrong, then the setup step failed, and you need to re-run the `POST` or `PATCH` request to the Tooling API.

### Step 3: Consider Propagation and Caching

Sometimes, changes like this can take a few minutes to propagate across all of Salesforce's application servers. It is also possible that the trigger definition is cached.

*   **Wait:** After verifying the configuration in Step 2, wait 5-10 minutes and try again.
*   **Force a Recompile:** Make a trivial change to your `PromptRequestEventTrigger` (like adding a space or a comment) and save it. This forces the Apex compiler to re-read the trigger and may clear any stale cache of its configuration. Then, re-run the test.

### Analysis and Most Likely Scenarios

1.  **Most Likely:** The debug log being inspected is for the wrong transaction (the initial REST call, not the event trigger's execution). The new debug statements will solve this ambiguity.
2.  **Possible:** The `PlatformEventSubscriberConfig` record was not created correctly or points to the wrong user/trigger. The Tooling API query will confirm or deny this.
3.  **Less Likely, but Possible:** There is a caching/propagation delay. Recompiling the trigger often resolves this.
4.  **The "If All Else Fails" Scenario:** If the debug logs *conclusively* show the trigger is running as "Automated Process" *despite* the `PlatformEventSubscriberConfig` being correctly configured and saved, then we are in very unusual territory, potentially a platform bug. In this scenario, the context of the `Queueable` becomes paramount. The `Queueable` job *should* be initiated by the user running the trigger. If the trigger truly runs as your user, the Queueable should too. If the trigger runs as Automated Process, the Queueable will also run as Automated Process.

Please perform the verification steps above, especially adding the debug lines and checking the *correct* debug log. The information from those logs will tell us exactly what is happening and lead us to the solution.
